# Enhanced /generate-book-content Endpoint Documentation

## Overview

The `/generate-book-content` endpoint has been successfully enhanced to include `author_id` and `collection_id` in both the book-level response and individual section data.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Book-Level Metadata
The `SanitizedBookResponse` now includes:
- `author_id`: Extracted from the first page's author data or fallback sources
- `collection_id`: Extracted from instance ID or details

### 2. Section-Level Metadata  
Each `BookSection` now includes:
- `author_id`: Individual page-level author ID (preferred) or fallback author ID
- `collection_id`: Collection ID associated with all sections

### 3. Hierarchical Author ID Extraction

The system uses a sophisticated extraction strategy:

#### Primary Source: Page-Level Data
```
instance.details.toc.categories[0].pages[0].author_id
```
- Extracts `author_id` from individual page data within table of contents
- Each section can have its own unique `author_id`
- Book-level `author_id` is set from the first page found with author data

#### Fallback Sources (if page-level data unavailable):
1. `instance.details.author.id`
2. `instance.details.author.user_id` 
3. `instance.details.author` (if string/numeric)

#### Collection ID Sources:
1. `instance.id` (primary)
2. `instance.details.collection_id`
3. `instance.details.id`

## API Response Structure

### Enhanced Book Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "book_title": "Course Title",
  "book_summary": "Course description",
  "book_brief_summary": "Brief description",
  "author_id": "10370001",           // NEW: Book-level author ID
  "collection_id": "4941429335392256", // NEW: Collection ID
  "chapters": [...],
  "total_chapters": 5,
  "total_sections": 25,
  "source": "credentials_from_environment"
}
```

### Enhanced Section Data
```json
{
  "title": "Section Title",
  "id": "4771234193080320",
  "slug": "section-slug",
  "author_id": "10370001",           // NEW: Section-specific author ID
  "collection_id": "4941429335392256" // NEW: Collection ID
}
```

## Integration Points

### 1. LaTeX Book Generation
The `/generate-latex-book` endpoint now includes enhanced metadata:
```json
{
  "book_data": {
    "title": "Course Title",
    "summary": "Course description", 
    "author_id": "10370001",         // NEW
    "collection_id": "4941429335392256", // NEW
    "chapters": 5,
    "sections": 25
  }
}
```

### 2. Section Content Generation
The `/generate-section-content` endpoint can now use the extracted `author_id` and `collection_id` as defaults:
- If not provided in request, uses extracted values from book structure
- Maintains backward compatibility with manual specification

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Existing API calls continue to work unchanged
- New fields are optional and default to `null` if not extractable
- No breaking changes to existing response structure

## Testing

### Unit Tests Available:
1. `test_enhanced_sanitization.py` - Mock data testing
2. `test_page_level_author.py` - Page-level extraction testing
3. `test_enhanced_book_content.py` - End-to-end API testing

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Page-level author extraction
- ✅ Fallback author extraction  
- ✅ Collection ID extraction
- ✅ Edge case handling (missing data)
- ✅ Multiple author scenarios
- ✅ Integration with LaTeX generation

## Error Handling

The enhancement includes robust error handling:
- Graceful degradation when author/collection data is missing
- Type validation for extracted IDs
- Empty string and null value filtering
- Fallback chains for maximum data extraction

## Production Readiness

✅ **Production Ready**
- Server successfully deployed with all enhancements
- All existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced metadata extraction operational
- Comprehensive test coverage validated

## Usage Examples

### Basic Book Content Generation
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate-book-content" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "educative_course_name": "course-name",
    "use_env_credentials": true
  }'
```

### Enhanced Response with Author/Collection Data
The response will now automatically include extracted `author_id` and `collection_id` in both book-level metadata and individual section data, enabling more precise content processing and API calls.
