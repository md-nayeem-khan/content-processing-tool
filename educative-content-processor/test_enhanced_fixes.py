engineers have never actually worked on large-scale systems before, so explaining how to build one seems daunting. Since
System Design interview questions are often open-ended, it can be difficult to know the best way to prepare.

However, as someone who has participated in hundreds of System Design interviews, I can assure you there is a correct way to approach these questions. With
the right mindset and preparation, you can feel confident and ready to tackle any System Design question that comes your way.

In
April 2008, I joined an \\href{https://www.educative.io/blog/25-years-of-developer-interviews}{internal team at Microsoft}working on a large-scale project to build a distributed storage solution. Amazon
launched its Simple Storage Service in 2006."""
